        <p>Sonar is an advanced open source service and server monitoring tool designed to be extremely modular and light (both in installation size and in resources consumed, while still providing a framework for plug-ins).</p>

          <p>While similar software exists, there is no major software implementation that was built from the ground up to be modular. Most monitoring tools offer an embedded web server that is usually ugly and not designed to be extensively modified.</p>
          <p>Sonar's Status Engine (the core logic) is designed to be run as a daemon or periodically, so that it doesn't constantly consume system resources.</p>
          <p>Sonar's goal is also to be really light on resources, meaning that the actual system load will be the input and output plug-ins and not the daemon itself, making it that much easier to optimize the infrastructure to suit low power machines.</p>

            <a id="bdm-sonar" class="anchor" href="#bdm-sonar" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why the silly name?</h2>

            <p>The idea behind Sonar is to have a central service (Status Engine) that periodically polls whatever the input plug-ins provide (services, servers, IoT devices, or basically almost anything with a network connection), it's designed to do periodic and sequential queries (like a ship's Sonar) to each of the elements provided by input plug-ins, so it works very similar to actual Sonar systems, since it doesn't need a service to be running on the target host, while it can still exahustively scan it. It also sounds cool ðŸ˜Š.</p>
